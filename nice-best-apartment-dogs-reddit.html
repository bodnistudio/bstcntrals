    <p>We are contemplating getting a dog. We live in a 6 unit with stairs. This subreddit is a great starting point for a lot of information, but you should always verify and expand upon what you&#039;ve read before putting it to use in your daily life. We are contemplating getting a dog. No dog other than a husky does well in extreme cold, but if you keep the coat longer in the winter it should be fine. I grew up with dogs in the family. They aren&#039;t even in the top 100 most common breeds in the us, but they can be great dogs. I found them purely by accident, and going through the typical searches of smartest or best dog, they never came up! Australian fuzzy hippo &amp; screaming post hugger. They are a lower energy dog but still happy to go to the park or go for walks. This subreddit is a great starting point for a lot of information, but you should always verify and expand upon what you&#039;ve read before putting it to use in your daily life. The poodle is an excellent dog at 8yrs old. When i moved into apartment life, i avoided getting a dog, because i figured apartment life would be unfair to the dog, and i wouldn&#039;t be home enough to give a dog enough exorcise.</p>
